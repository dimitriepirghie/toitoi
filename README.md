TODO -

- Define or use available ontologies for IoT
- Create two use cases and collect data
- Analyse data when an event occurs. (triggered by user or by some anomalies/fluctuations in data)
- Provide answers for questions like: why this event occurred ? create graphs.

Google Cloud
  1. Software platform

    App/Compute or Container Engine - link IoT devices to Cloud.
  2. Mining and reasoning

    Load data from IoT devices, "big data" files, preprocess and mine/analyse.

    DataProc - Hadoop, (Spark, Pig) - analyses on data

    BigTable - ?

    Dataflow - ?

    GC Natural Language API

    Web Sematic RDF Format.

    Ontologies

Arduino/Raspberry PI
  1. Collect data and control devices.

  2. Examples of use cases:
     - Smart agriculture:

          Irrigation, temperature monitoring etc.

        Having harvest data and ground data parameter answer question like:

        Why the production of potato is less than the previous year ?
     - Smart City:
        Track public transportation and users ?

        Find a better route or implement a new route ?
